4.) References used to complete the assignment
Used https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_return_arrays_from_functions.htm to see how to use a pointer since you can't return an array in C++;
I went to TLT tutoring to figure out how to return a pointer to an array. I ended up restructuring my program after and didn't end up returning the pointer
Used CPlusPlus.com to figure out various syntax issues I was having.
Went on StackOverFlow.com during debugging to try and solve the errors I was having. Learned how to use Ifndef from that site too.
